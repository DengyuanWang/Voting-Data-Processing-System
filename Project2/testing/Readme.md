#There are several things I need to give explainations

1. For testing, I create two folders which are systemtesting and unittesting.
2. systemtesting contain another four folders, which are extremeTest,
   extremeTestLog, normalTest and normalTestLog.
3. unittesting contain all unit test from our code which are public or
   protected method. 
4. We develop GUI for the first project, so we borrow the GUI from the Project1.
   but my group is a three man group, I get the permission from professor that
   we do not need to do the unit testing for GUI.
